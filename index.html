        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first year student at UCR studying poli sci looking to one day become a PI attorney. This dream of mine started after a knee injury I suffered during a high school football game. I had to get stem cell therapy and platelet-rich plasma therapy. I also had to maintain a serious regimen of physical therapy going four times a week.  At first, I hated going to physical therapy, but I ended up finding out that I would go more for my mental health than my knee. Football was my outlet and I felt that was taken from me. My physical therapist, Eli, helped me realize that was not true. He showed me that it was an experience that I had to go through to understand how to not just cope with a problem, but to strive to fix it no matter how bad the situation may seem. Eli became my best friend. I loved going to his office daily just to tell him how I was doing or how school went. In eleven weeks I healed an injury that keeps athletes out for at least eight months. <br><br>

        I kept in touch with the doctor and he offered me a summer internship at his office. I became his front desk receptionist and I had a lot of responsibilities. I contacted patients daily to ensure they followed their physical therapy treatment plan. I also created new patient files and sorted old ones. I also had to assemble billing files and process payments. Most patients came in because of a work accident so I had to directly contact their attorneys to figure out what had to be done with their clients. Soon I realized that most attorneys don't care for their clients as long as they get paid. This stuck with me and I decided I wanted to become a PI attorney but I wanted to do it right.<br><br>

        I am responsible, hard-working, a fast leaner, and I work great with a team.
